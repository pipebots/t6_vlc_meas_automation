    """Remote control of an Keysight N9000A Spectrum Analyser using SCPI cmds.

    A class representation of a Keysight N9000A Spectrum Analyser, that
    provides remote control capabilities through the use of SCPI commands. A
    connection is established over a GPIB or a LAN interface. Currently only
    very basic functionality is supported.

    Attributes:
        instr_conn: A `pyvisa` object holding the remote connection to the
                    instrument. Used to send SCPI commands and read the
                    responses.
        name: A `str` with a human-friendly name for the instrument, used to
              identify it in the logs.
        logger: A `logging.Logger` object to which to save info and diagnostic
                messages.
        query_delay: A `float` with the delay, in seconds, between VISA write
                     and read operations.
        vendor: A `str` with the vendor name, as provided by the instrument
        model_number: A `str` with the model number, as provided by the
                      instrument.
        serial_number: A `str` with the serial number, as provided by the
                       instrument.
        fw_version: A `str` with the firmware version, as provided by the
                    instrument.
        details: A human-friendly `str` with a summary of the instrument's
                 self-reported details.
        frequency: A `float` or an `int` with the CW frequency of the Signal
                   Generator. Currently only supports Hz.
        power: A `float` or an `int` with the RF output power of the Signal
               Generator. Currently only supports dBm.
        output: A `bool` showing the state of the RF output of the instrument,
                i.e. ON / OFF.
        mod_state: A `bool` showing whether modulation is enabled or not.

                    initialised before the instrument.
            address: A `str` with an IPv4 address or an `int` with a GPIB
                     address. Only primary GPIB addresses, i.e. 0 - 30 are
                     supported.
            instr_name: A `str` with a a name, or alias, for the instrument,

            logger: An optional `logging.Logger` object to which to write
                    diagnostic and info messages. If one is not supplied,
                    a new one is created internally.
